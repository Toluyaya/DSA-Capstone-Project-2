## CASE SCENARIO 
- Analyse the company data and generate insights that the Palmoria managementteam would need to address
- Your analysis should be visualised using appropriate charts 
- Your focus should be on gender-related issues within the organization and its regions 
- The insights required are based on your discretion. However, Mr Gamma, as an insider, has offered to give you pointers on areas you need to pay attention to

## Analysis Task
1. What is the gender distribution in the organization? Distil to regions and departments 
2. Show insights on ratings based on gender 
3. Analyse the company’s salary structure. Identify if there is a gender pay gap. If there is, identify the department and regions that should be the focus of management 
4. A recent regulation was adopted which requires manufacturing companies to pay employees a minimum of $90,000 
- Does Palmoria meet this requirement?
- Show the pay distribution of employees grouped by a band of $10,000. For example:
- How many employees fall into a band of $10,000 – $20,000, $20,000 – $30,000, etc.?
- Also visualize this by regions

### Bonus Section Information
